# Team_Member_management

The goal of this project is to create a simple team-member management application that allows the user to view, edit, add, and delete team members based on their roles (e.g regular or admin).
Django is the framework.
Python, HTML, and CSS are examples of programming languages.

There are three pages in this project:

1) List Page: This is the application's home page, where all team members are listed with their roles and contact information.
To add a new team member, click the "+" symbol in the upper right corner. By clicking on it, the user is taken to the Add page. By selecting a team member from the list, you will be taken to the Edit page.

2) Add Page: On this page, a user must fill in all details; all fields are required. By pressing the save button, a new member is added to the database and redirected to the list page. The user can now see newly added members on the list.

3) Edit Page: By clicking on any user from the List Page, pre-enrolled data of team members from the database is fetched and displayed on the screen. Users can edit or remove a member from this page. By clicking the save button, updated data will override existing data in the database, and details of team members will be deleted from the database.
